##### *Modern implementation of a file monitoring system for iOS*

This project is a demo of how to monitor changes in the filesystem on an iOS device. It uses GCD and prefers Objective-C over C wherever possible.

Based heavily on Cocoanetics' [Monitoring a Folder with GCD](http://www.cocoanetics.com/2013/08/monitoring-a-folder-with-gcd)
