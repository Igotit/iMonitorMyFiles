##### *Modern implementation of a file monitoring system for iOS*

This project is a demo of how to monitor changes in the filesystem on an iOS device. It also demonstrates how to continue tracking a file even when another app deletes and re-creates the file (TextEdit does this whenever you save a file).

Based heavily on Cocoanetics' [Monitoring a Folder with GCD](http://www.cocoanetics.com/2013/08/monitoring-a-folder-with-gcd)
